This is a working packer tool which provisions the RHEL_8, updates it with the scripts, cleans the whole system, get's new machine ID and converts it into a template for future
VM creation on VMware vSphere.

- Using packer but this is RHEL 8 developer license vm, we need to login to the vm and subscribe it to the rhel developer subscription for updates.
